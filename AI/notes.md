* **Reasoning** - MAchine should think something reasonable, something logical, e.g if we know that to qualify a particular exam the scoring marks is 40% and someone has scored 60% therefore we know that the person is going to qualify the exam, we want to think machines in a similar way so we want to put this reasoning/logic in the machine too.
* **Learning** - Just like humans who learn from their past experinces and behaviour, similarly we want machines to learn from their past experiences and use them for future references and can perform better in future situations.
* **Problem solving** - Whether we are doing game playing or any kind of mathematical computation then we need our computer to solve various types of problems, we want machines to think just like our mind and approach the particular problem just like humans do
* **Perception** - Just like humans, who percept things with their sense organs, similarly we want machines to percept things just like humans, for e.g tesla has made automatic cars and lets say that car is running and on a particular path it found a jam, so it will percept that and will take a decision and will notify other cars so that they will not come to that path.
